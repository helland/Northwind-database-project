# Northwind - A database problem to learn Django

This is an introductory project I started to teach myself Django. It includes a fully populated database that can be found [here]() that I've used to create an example website for handling said data. After spending a week and a half on example exercises and guides (mostly W3schools and Tech with tim), I spend this week coding the project found here. I'm uploading this now, without proper documentation or much finished because there's a chance I'll have to switch to a different task. If so, I'll at least write a more comprehensive readme file before abandoning it.
